Creating a detailed and comprehensive guide for setting up and running a Next.js project locally is essential for onboarding new developers and ensuring that they can get started without any hitches. Below, I will provide a full documentation template that includes steps from cloning the repository to deploying the application.

Full Documentation for Setting Up a Next.js Project Locally
1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have installed:
- Node.js (version 12.x or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
- Git for version control

2. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raiputradrmwn/Web-Task-Management.git
cd Web-Task-Management
```

3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# Or if you are using Yarn
yarn install
```
4. Configure Environment Variables
If your project requires environment variables (e.g., API keys), set them up by copying the .env.example file to a new file called .env and filling out the necessary details:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the .env file with the appropriate values.

5. Run the Development Server
Launch the development server to start working on your project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# Or using Yarn
yarn dev
```

This command will start the Next.js development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your browser to see the running application.
